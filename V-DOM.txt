1. What is the Virtual DOM?
ðŸ”¹ Real DOM vs Virtual DOM:
Real DOM (Document Object Model) is the actual structure of a webpage that the browser uses to render content.

Virtual DOM (V-DOM) is a lightweight JavaScript copy of the real DOM.

ðŸ”¹ Why Virtual DOM?
Updating the real DOM is slow because:

Every small change (like a button click) causes the entire real DOM to re-render.

This slows down performance.

ðŸ”¹ How Virtual DOM Helps:
React creates a virtual DOM in memory.

When your UI changes, React:

Creates a new virtual DOM.

Compares it with the old virtual DOM (using a process called Diffing).

Finds out what exactly changed.

Updates only that part in the real DOM (instead of reloading the whole thing).

âœ… Result: Faster performance and better user experience.

2. What is Reconciliation in React?
ðŸ”¹ Reconciliation = Comparing + Updating
It is the process React uses to update the DOM.

When state or props change, React:

Creates a new virtual DOM tree.

Compares it with the previous tree.

Calculates the difference.

Efficiently updates only the changed parts of the real DOM.

ðŸ”¹ How React compares:
It assumes:

Two elements of different types (e.g., <div> and <p>) are completely different.

It will destroy the old and create a new one.

Keys help with efficient comparison (especially in lists).

3. What is React Fiber?
ðŸ”¹ React Fiber is the new engine (since React 16) for rendering.
Think of it as the brain behind virtual DOM and reconciliation.

ðŸ”¹ Why Fiber was introduced?
Old React couldnâ€™t pause or prioritize tasks. Everything was done at once â†’ caused janky UIs.

Fiber solved this by introducing:

Incremental rendering (can pause work and come back to it).

Prioritization (more important updates first).

Better error handling.

Concurrency support (used in Reactâ€™s concurrent mode).

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts of Fiber:
Fiber Node: Each React element has a corresponding Fiber node (a JS object with information about the component).

Work Units: React splits rendering into chunks (units of work).

Time-slicing: Allows React to do some work, take a break, and continue â†’ keeps the app responsive.

ðŸ”„ Summary Table
Concept:	Explanation
Virtual DOM	:A lightweight JS representation of the real DOM
Reconciliation	:The diffing and updating process React uses to sync changes
Fiber:	The new React engine that improves rendering, makes it faster and smarter

ðŸŒŸ Real Life Analogy:
Imagine the real DOM is your full school project printed on paper.

Virtual DOM is your editable digital copy on your laptop.

You only print (update) the changed parts, not the entire document.

Reconciliation is you comparing old vs new versions.

Fiber is like your brain deciding which task to do first (title page? conclusion? charts?), and doing them in small chunks.
